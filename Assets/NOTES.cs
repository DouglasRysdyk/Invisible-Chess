TODO: 
- Exact bookmark -- https://youtu.be/2qua0_SO_M8?t=1262 
- I dunno if the tutorial will go over Promoting
- There is some sort of out of bounds error involving the pawns that I haven't run into yet, but makes sense and others say it exists.  
- Are the Queen and King in the correct positions?  
- BUG -- When white wins the end screen says "White team wins" and "Black team wins".  I think this only happens when the black team wins first.  
  - I'll tackle this is Chessboard > OnResetButton.  I'll get the victory text and disable them both.  
  - If that doesn't work I'll think of something else.

Notes: 
- This video has a really simple way of doing turns between two players.  It can probably be scaled up easily, but more importantly when he does the multiplayer videos it will hopefully be expanded on.
